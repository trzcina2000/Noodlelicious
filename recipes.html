            <div class="text-center">
                <h2><strong>Ingredients needed:</strong></h2>
                <ul class="list-centered">
                    <li><strong>Noodles</strong> - we recomend using egg noodles as they cook quicker and are thicker. If you are unable to find any egg noodles, do not worry as any other noodles will also work.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soy sauce</strong> - use dark soy sauce if you'd like a more ditinct taste to your noodles. If you prefer a more lighter taste, feel freee to use light soy sauce.</li>
                    <li><strong>Oil</strong> - we recommend using sesame oil as it goes really well with soy sauce. If you like a spicy kick, you can use chili oil.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chilli sauce</strong> - if you're using sesame oil and want a little heat use some chilli or sweet chilli sauce. If you're using chilli oil and you feel like this could be enough of spice, 
                        feel free not to use any chilli sauce or id you want your noodles to be even spicer add both to your recipe. </li>
                    <li><strong>Garlic</strong> - This recipe is quite garlic heavy, just the way we like it. If you don't love garlic as much as we do, then you can reduce the amount used or just leave it out completely.
                         We crushed fresh garlic, but you could use frozen or garlic from a jar to save even more time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Onions</strong> - Some fresh spring onion will add nice taste and texture to the dish. You can either fry the onion with the garlic or use it raw as a garnish. </li>
                </ul>
                <h2> <strong>Steps to make our noodles:</strong></h2>
                <p><strong>One:</strong> Cook your noodles so that they are ready to be added to the sauce mixture. Time of cooking the noodles depends on the type of noodles you'll use. Most noodles will tell you the recomended time at the back of the packaging.</p>
                <p><strong>Two:</strong> Put 1 tablespoon of sesame oil, the soy sauce and sweet chilli sauce in a bowl and mix.</p>
                <p><strong>Three:</strong> In a frying pan, heat the rest of the oil and then add the spring onions and garlic. Cook on a low heat for 3 minutes, until softened.</p>
                <p><strong>Four:</strong> Add the noodles and stir, cooking for 2 minutes.</p>
                <p><strong>Five:</strong> Add the sauce, mix well and cook for 1 minute and serve.</p>

            <h1 class="text-center"><strong>Garlic Shrimp Noodles</strong></h1>
            <div class="text-center">
                <h2><strong>Ingredients needed:</strong></h2>
                <ul class="list-centered">
                    <li><strong>Garlic</strong> - please use fresh garlic</li>
                    <li><strong>Fish sauce</strong> - a classic Thai seasoning that tends to have a strong smell.</li>
                    <li><strong>Oyster (flavored) sauce</strong> - another sauce that is widely use in a lot of Chinese and Asian cooking.</li>
                    <li><strong>Butter</strong> - cooking oil cannot hold a candle next to the flavor butter brings to this dish.</li>
                    <li><strong>Brown sugar</strong> - to balance out the saltiness from the fish sauce.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sesame oil</strong> - a nutty, fragrantly oil used a lot in Asian cooking.</li>
                    <li><strong>Raw shrimp</strong> - do not use cooked shrimp. Fresh, good quality shrimp makes a big difference to the quality of this Shrimp Garlic Noodle recipe as a whole.</li>
                    <li><strong>Egg noodles</strong> - you can use any noodles of your choice.</li>
                    <li><strong>Green onions</strong> - for a great texture and taste.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2> <strong>Steps to make our noodles:</strong></h2>
                <p><strong>One: Boil Noodles</strong> - cook or soften the noodles you are using. Most noodles will tell you the recomended time at the back of the packaging.</p>
                <p><strong>Two: Sear Shrimp and Make Garlic Sauce</strong> - While noodles are boiling, go ahead and heat a large skillet with cooking oil. Sear the shrip until it turns orange/pink, after that remove the shrimp from the skillet. 
                    Set shrimp aside, and use the same skillet to make the sauce. When making the sauce, first melt the butter on the skillet, then bring together all the sauce ingredients - fish sauce, oyster sauce, garlic, and brown sugar. 
                    Mix it together, and then scoop out about 1/4 cup of the pasta water from pot that is boiling your pasta, and add it into the sauce to dilute it.</p>
                <p><strong>Three: Toss noodles and shrimp in sauce</strong> - When noodles are done, drain them and then add them to the garlic butter sauce. Use a pair of tongs to give them a nice toss so that they are coated evenly in the sauce. Then add shrimp, and toss them along with the noodles in the sauce.</p>
                <p><strong>Four: Garnish and serve</strong> - Green onions give this Garlic Noodles with Shrimp dish a nice bite of freshness and also some crunchy texture.</p>
